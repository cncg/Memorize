# Memorize - ios application using swift and swiftUI 2024

Following the Stanford iOS Development course in 2023, I am working on the game taught within the course. This game is highly known and enjoyed all over the world. It is a card Memory Game! 

This application is very simple and showcases a memory game using cards, animations and images for iOS. You pick a card and it shows you a picture, then you flip another card in hopes it is a match! You exercise your memory and hope to match the cards to their respective pictures. 

More information will be added here to the readme.MD as the application progresses. Enjoy!
