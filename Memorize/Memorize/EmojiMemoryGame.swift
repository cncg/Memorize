//
//- Why use a class instead of a struct here?
//  Our View Model is part of the UI , it has to be because its packaging up whats going on in the model. It isnt creating views and such but thats why we immport swiftui , it needs to know!
//- what is a super class?
//  Remember that classes are reference types rather than strcut that are value types!
//- what are access codes? what is private var? (private means that the only code that can use this var and use it, is private to where it is)
//- what is closure syntax?
//- what is static vars and funcitons? how can they relate to private??
//- what is namespace?
//- why are global variables bad?
